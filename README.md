#### In Rio de Janeiro, temperatures can exceed 35°C on some days. As my house gets very hot, I decided to create a project to monitor the temperature at any time, even away from home.

## Prerequisites

- ESP8266 (ESP12 or [ESP01/01S](https://github.com/esp8266/esp8266-wiki/wiki/Hardware_versions) with GPIO16 connected to RST. Make sure you have the ESP8266 board add-on installed.
- Temperature Sensor [DS18B20 (Dallas)](https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/227472/DALLAS/DS18B20.html).
- ~3.3V power supply.
- Arduino IDE and necessary libraries.
- Blynk account.
> [!TIP]
> It's possible to use other microcontrollers, but code changes may be necessary. I chose ESP12 because I couldn't solder the GPIO16 pin to the RST on the ESP01S, without this it's not possible to use the ESP.deepSleep() function.

## Libraries (Arduino IDE)
- ESP8266WiFi
- BlynkSimpleEsp8266
- OneWire
- DallasTemperature

## How to use

1. Install the necessary **libraries** and load the firmware into the **ESP12** .
2. Choose a power source **(3.3V)** to power the **ESP12** and the **sensor**.
3. Connect the **ESP12** to the **DS18B20** sensor according to the [diagram](https://github.com/math1p/IoT-Thermostat-ESP12-and-DS18B20/tree/f4058d7162584688534fe797a7ba8f8e52e69ae5/Schematics%20ESP01S%20%26%20ESP12).
4. Configure the settings and make adjustments according to your preference in the `config.h` file.
5. Log in to your [Blynk](https://blynk.cloud) account.
6. The thermostat will start working automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the `config.h` file it's possible to adjust some settings such as: Information for connecting to the **Blynk** server, **network credentials for WiFi connection**, the **pin** to which the sensor is connected and the **intervals** for reading and sending data.

## Notes

It is important to highlight that it is not possible to view the temperature directly, requiring a previously configured WiFi connection so that the ESP8266-01S can communicate with the Blynk server. For a project with a similar objective that does not require an internet connection, I suggest using a microcontroller like the ATtiny85 and a display (TM1637).

> [!NOTE]
> I won't provide information about Blynk configuration, but I can tell you that you should use Datastreams and Virtualpins.
> For information about Blynk, see [Blynk Documentation](https://docs.blynk.io/en).
